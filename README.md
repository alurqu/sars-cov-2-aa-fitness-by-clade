SARS-COV-2 Amino Acid Residue Fitness by Nextstrain Clade

Bloom and Neher estimates of SARS-CoV-2 amino acid residue mutation fitness
by clade https://github.com/jbloomlab/SARS2-mut-fitness/blob/main/results/aa_fitness/aamut_fitness_by_clade.csv
separated into files by clade, with a minimum delta_fitness, and eliminating aa mutations that match the clade founder aa.

This is a direct derivative of the Bloom and Neher results from https://github.com/jbloomlab/SARS2-mut-fitness.
